- **Break timer** (`t`): opens a full-screen HUD that floats over the deck.
  Number keys pick a preset and start the countdown; `Space` pauses and resumes;
  `t` or `Esc` closes it. At zero the digits turn critical and flash. While it is
  open the deck does not advance, so it is safe to leave projected during a
  break. It needs no network and works from `file://`. The presets default to
  `5,10,15,20,30,45,60` minutes; override them in `si.conf` with `timer.time` and
  `timer.unit` (minutes or seconds). The countdown shows as digits or, with
  `timer.face: analog`, an analog sport-clock dial — toggle it live in the HUD.
  A `timer.animation` runs a themed animation layer behind the translucent HUD
  (SLIDE │ ANIMATION │ TIMER) — built-ins `waves`, `orbit`, `bokeh`, or your own;
  list several (comma-separated) for a toggle (a **None** option is always
  offered). Once the countdown starts the HUD hides its presets and toggles so
  only the clock and the animation show — `Space` still pauses; any other key or
  a click brings the controls back. See §16 and `docs/timer-animations.md`.

- **Find a slide** (`/`): opens a search palette over the deck. Type to search
  slide titles and body text — results list the slide number, title and the
  matched snippet, ranked title-matches first; `↑`/`↓` move the selection and
  `Enter` (or a click) jumps. Type a **number** to go straight to that slide
  (e.g. `/12` → slide 12). `Esc` closes. Disable with `feature.find: off`.
  Below the slides it also lists the **other pages** of the folder, matched
  loosely (the letters in order, not necessarily together: `idx` or `inde`
  finds `index.html`, `lab3` finds `lab-03-quorum.html`): the index, the other
  decks and labs, their PDFs (`--pdf`), any other `.html` already in the
  output folder, and the `links.*` of `si.conf`. `Enter` opens the page.
  `si build` writes the list into each deck (names and titles only, so it works
  from `file://`); `si play` reads the folder on every request.

- **Draw** (`a`): a transient pen over the current slide, for circling or
  underlining as you talk. Drag to draw (mouse, touch, or pen — pen pressure
  varies the stroke); the toolbar picks the colour (accent, red, green, ink) and
  the brush size (thin / medium / thick); `c` cycles colour, `e` erases strokes,
  `z` undoes the last, `x` clears all, `Esc` turns it off. Strokes use the theme
  colours and clear when you change slides; they are not saved and do not print.

- The URL hash is the position (`#7`, `#7.2`); reloads keep it, so live
  reload in `si play` stays on your slide.
- A progress bar and a slide counter (with the step) sit at the bottom; the
  controls appear when the mouse moves.
- When a slide is too tall for the window its canvases, diagrams and images
  shrink first (down to about 60 %) so a figure plus bullets clears the
  footer, then the fluid type shrinks a little, then the slide scrolls;
  nothing is cut off. The figure cap itself is the `--si-figure-max` token
  (default `60cqb`; the `center` layout adds `6cqb`, columns `14cqb`), so a
  theme with a taller footer band can lower it for every slide:

  ```css
  :root { --si-figure-max: 52cqb; }
  ```
- **Print** (browser print, or print to PDF): one slide per page at the deck
  `aspect`, every step revealed, canvases in their final state. `si build --pdf`
  writes a `<name>.pdf` next to each deck using headless Chrome (needs Chrome or
  Chromium installed; without it, HTML is still written).
- **Video**: `si build talk.md --mp4` films the deck to `<name>.mp4` (1920×1080,
  H.264): every slide and every build step as the audience sees it, each held
  for its share of the slide's `(N min)` (else 3 s), then the slide transition,
  the build step and the canvas morph filmed as they move (30 fps). `--dwell 2`
  holds every view 2 s instead, for a short teaser:

  ```bash
  si build talk.md --mp4 --dwell 2   # talk.mp4: a 2 s look at every slide and step
  ```

  It needs headless Chrome and ffmpeg (`brew install ffmpeg`). si runs the page
  slowed down while it films, so the motion is smooth whatever the machine;
  `--dissolve` films still views that dissolve into each other in 0.4 s
  instead (faster, and what si falls back to when filming the motion fails).
- **Open on a phone**: run `si play <dir> --addr 0.0.0.0:7070` to serve on your
  network; `si play` then prints a LAN URL and a QR code to scan. (The default
  address is loopback-only, so it prints the `--addr` hint instead.)

- **Play terminal** (`` ` ``, backtick): a drawer of real shells on your machine
  for live demos — play-only and loopback-only, never shipped in a built deck.
  Full reference: `docs/terminal.md`.

- **Runbook** (front matter `runbook: cockroach.json`): a command cheat-sheet in a
  right drawer of the play terminal. The JSON is a list of categories, each with
  entries (`label`, `description`, `command`, `target: sql|bash`):

  ```json
  { "categories": [ { "name": "Cluster Info", "entries": [
      { "label": "Show Nodes", "description": "live nodes",
        "command": "SELECT node_id, is_live FROM crdb_internal.gossip_nodes;", "target": "sql" } ] } ] }
  ```

  Each command is syntax-highlighted (by `target`) so you can read it at a glance;
  there's a filter box. Every entry has **Copy** (puts the command at the shell
  prompt without running it, and on the clipboard) and **Run** (the same, then
  Enter); clicking the entry itself is Copy, Shift-click Run. A command waits
  until the shell has drawn its prompt, and is sent as a paste where the shell
  supports it (zsh, bash 5.1+), so a multi-line command shows whole and runs only
  on Enter. The shape matches the cockroach-engineering-tool VS Code extension's
  `runbook.json`, so an exported runbook drops in unchanged. Like the terminal, it
  appears only in `si play` on a loopback address — a built deck never loads it, so
  rules #2/#7 still hold for shipped HTML. `si check` validates the path and JSON.

  A command may hold **placeholders**: `{{name}}` or `{{name:default}}` (name
  `[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_-]*`, default any text without `}`). The drawer asks for a
  value for each distinct name (first occurrence and its default win), then Copy
  or Run the command with every occurrence replaced; Esc cancels and types nothing.
  Placeholders are highlighted in the command.

- **Demos** (front matter `demos: ../demos/`): demo scripts, plain markdown, in a
  second side panel of the play terminal (`▶ Demos`, one panel open at a time).
  A drop-down lists the demos by their `# ` title (else the file name); the panel
  shows the whole script (headings, prose, tables, `>` quotes) and every
  ```` ```bash ```` / `sh` / `shell` / `zsh` / `console` / `sql` / `powershell`
  block gets **Copy** and **Run**, as in the runbook. Blocks in any other
  language (```` ```text ```` for expected output) stay plain. The value is a
  comma-separated list of `.md` files or folders, relative to the deck; a folder
  gives its `*.md` except `README.md`, `index.md` and `_`-prefixed files. Like
  the runbook: play and loopback only, never in a built deck; `si check`
  reports a missing path. The last demo picked is remembered.

  ```markdown
  ---
  title: Session 1
  demos: ../demos/
  ---
  ```

  ```json
  { "label": "Pods", "command": "kubectl -n {{ns:messaging}} get pods {{pod}}", "target": "bash" }
  ```

  Not placeholders, typed verbatim: `{{.Server.Version}}`, `{{json .}}`,
  `${HOME}`, `{print $1}`, `{a: .b}`, and the Go-template keywords `{{end}}`,
  `{{else}}`, `{{break}}`, `{{continue}}`, `{{nil}}`, `{{true}}`, `{{false}}`. The file may also carry a top-level `name`
  (the drawer title) and `description`.

### Studio (`si --web`)

`si --web [dir] [--addr 127.0.0.1:7070] [--no-open]` opens a browser editor for
the decks in `dir`: file tree, markdown editor, live preview and the `si check`
report. It listens on a loopback address only and is never part of a built deck.
See `docs/studio.md`.

```bash
si --web examples --no-open
```

### In the terminal

`si play talk.md --terminal` presents the deck in the terminal itself: no
browser, over SSH, in tmux. Every rule above draws as text and colour from the
same markdown:

- **The theme's colours** (its dark values, or light with `mode: light`): accent,
  muted text, the `==highlight==` band, card colours.
- **Titles of title, section and closing slides** in block letters made of
  half-block characters (falling back to bold text where a letter has no glyph
  or a word does not fit); the big number of a `big-number` slide too.
- **Builds** (`<!-- step -->`, `<!-- steps -->`) reveal one at a time; going back
  to a slide shows it whole.
- **Layouts:** columns (`<!-- column -->`, two-col and split with text left and
  media right) side by side when the terminal is 60 columns or wider, stacked
  below that; `center`, `quote` and `big-number` centred.
- **Code** highlighted with si's own highlighter, in a box with its title,
  `hl=` lines, `linenos` and callouts (❶); **tables** with borders and the
  column alignment; **cards**, **badges** and **logo lockups** as text.
- **Images** (PNG, JPEG, GIF) as real pictures in terminals that can show them
  (Kitty, Ghostty and WezTerm through the Kitty graphics protocol; iTerm2 through
  its inline images), and as half-block pixels everywhere else, inside tmux too
  (`SI_PICTURES=kitty|iterm|halfblock` overrides the guess); **stage diagrams**
  as boxes and arrows, the travelling dot moving along them.
- **Animated canvases** (`<!-- svg: -->`) drawn with characters: boxes, wires,
  text and dots from the SVG's shapes, in the state the deck has reached (the
  same words, `+w` / `-w` and build-step ops as in the browser). The helper
  attributes work (`data-show`, `data-hide`, `data-ok`, `data-alert`,
  `data-flow`, `data-packets`, `data-grow`) and so do the canvas's own CSS state
  rules for `opacity`, `display`, `fill` and `transform` (translate, scaleX).
  They move: packets travel along their wires, flows march, alerts pulse, and a
  part that moves between two states slides there when you press →. Other CSS
  (`offset-path`, counters, filters) shows the end state. SVG images, Mermaid
  diagrams and video show a labelled placeholder: the browser draws them.

Keys are the browser's: → Space `n` next, ← `p` back, `g` / `G` first and
last, `o` overview, `t` restart the timer, `?` keys, `q` quit. The deck reloads
when a file changes, and the slides reflow when the terminal is resized.

`si play talk.md --terminal --notes` in a second terminal (another tmux pane,
or the laptop screen while the projector shows the first) is the
teleprompter: it follows the presenter over a local socket and drives it back
(Space and ← move the slides from the notes). It shows the `Notes:` script with
the `[CLICK]` cues as badges (done ones ticked, the next one highlighted),
slide and total timers against the `(N min)` plan with the pace (on time,
ahead, behind), the clock, and the current and next slide. It scrolls by itself
(`a` on / off, `+` / `-` speed, ↑ ↓ by hand); Tab switches to the `Points:`.
It also follows a deck open in a browser: with `si play` (or `si serve`)
running, `--notes` listens to the server at `--addr` (default
`127.0.0.1:7070`) for the page of the same name, and Space / ← move the browser
deck. Without either it moves on its own.

`si play talk.md --terminal --dump 4 --size 100x30` prints slide 4 with every
build shown (ANSI colours) and exits: for scripts, READMEs and checks.
